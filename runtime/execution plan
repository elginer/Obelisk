The compiler generates an assembler file.

Every function application, of a function $g, occurs inside another function $f.

Functions are essentially lists of function applications (with a few exceptions).

Store the return address after a null byte on the stack.  When reading the stack for active heap objects, anything after a null byte is ignored.
