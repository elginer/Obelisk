     text: "Lexical syntax is associated with the {external lexer Language/Obelisk/Lexer.hs}."
   - "Before parsing, Obelisk source undergoes lexical analysis where comments and whitespace are removed. The legal tokens are then parsed as set out in {section 2.2 Grammar grammar}."
   - "Whitespace consists of the space character, aswell as the following characters, represented here by their escape codes:"
   - class: example
     text: " \\n\\t\\r "
   - "Obelisk supports both line and block comments."
   - "Line comments are started by the token {class // example}  and last until the next newline."
   - "Block comments are started by the token {class /* example} and last until the token {class */ example}. Block comments in Obelisk are not nested."

   - "Here is an example of source code running throught Obelisk's lexical analysis.  The source code before lexical analysis:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False

       \n\{
       \n   (is fun)

       \n/* That was a bit pointless
       \n   but hey ho, it was just an example! */"
