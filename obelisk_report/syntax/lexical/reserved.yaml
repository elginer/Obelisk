unique: reserved

   - "Reserved words are identified during lexical analysis. These reserved words are:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text:
        "op
       \n
       \ndef
       \n
       \nwhere
       \n
       \nlet
       \n
       \ntrue
       \n
       \nfalse
       \n
       \nif
       \n
       \n->"
   - "In addition, Obelisk's grammar assigns special significance to these symbols which are also identified during lexing:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "'
           \n
           \n(
           \n
           \n)
           \n
           \n\{
           \n
           \n}
           \n
           \n#
           \n"
   - "The primary difference between special symbols and reserved words, is that      an {section identifer identifer} MAY contain a reserved word, but they MUST not contain special symbols."
