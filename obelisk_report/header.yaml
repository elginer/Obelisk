   - "Obelisk is a general purpose programming language."
   - "Obelisk aims to:"
   - "* Be an eagerly evaluated, functional programming language."
   - "* Support functions with expressive, polymorphic types, but to be utterly type safe."
   - wrap: False
     text:
        "* Respect functional purity, with no mutable variables in functions...
       \n     ...but also to support a class-based object system, where objects control mutable state, represented by their instance variables"
   - "* Be supportive of simple and efficient implementation: implementation of an Obelisk compiler which produces competitively fast code should not warrant a PhD dissertation."
   - "* Be developed in an free and open manner."
