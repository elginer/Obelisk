   - "Obelisks semantics are described in two parts:"
   - "* Checking an Obelisk program for {section correctness correct}."
   - "* {section Run-time semantics runtime} of an Obelisk program."
   - "The following formal definitions are used throughout this section:"
   - "The set of available {section Obelisks grammar elements grammar} is defined as {class O example}."
   - "An Obelisk program {class P example}, which is a valid production of Obelisk's grammar - a list of function definitions.  Hence:"
   - class: example
     language: math
